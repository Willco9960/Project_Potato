# 🥔 Project Potato  

### A Custom 4-bit Processor Built from Scratch  

Designed in **Digital**, a logic simulator by [hneemann](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).

Project Potato is a **custom-designed 4-bit processor**, built as a learning experience in digital logic and computer architecture. This project explores how processors work at the fundamental level, with the ultimate goal of designing a **processor capable of running retro games** like those found on the **Atari, Game Boy, and NES**.

## 🔥 Features & Capabilities (WIP) 

✔ **4-bit Processor Design** – Handles basic operations with a simple instruction set.  
✔ **Custom ALU with Addition Functionality** – Supports arithmetic directly using RAM and registers.  
✔ **RAM & Register Sharing a Data Bus** – Optimized for efficient data transfer and computation.  
✔ **Basic Program Execution** – Can load values, perform arithmetic, store results, and halt execution.

## 🎯 Project Goals  

1️⃣ **Understand Processor Design** – Learn the fundamentals of CPU architecture.  
2️⃣ **Build a Simple Yet Functional CPU** – Implement key components like RAM, an ALU, and a control unit.  
3️⃣ **Experiment with Assembly-like Instructions** – Develop a simple instruction set to execute programs.  
4️⃣ **Improve Performance & Complexity** – Add branching, I/O, and possibly stack-based operations.  
5️⃣ **Expand into a Retro Game Processor** – Create a specialized processor to assist in running **old-school console games (Atari, Game Boy, NES, etc.)**.
